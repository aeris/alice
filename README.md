# Alice

Alice is a tool to monitor changes on websites.

It's a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application, using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for storage.

Website to monitor can be configured to check only part of the content, based on text search or CSS selector.

It was initially developped to help [Projet Arcadie](https://projetarcadie.com/) to track declaration of assets or parliamentary assistants of French politicians.

It's released under [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) license.

You can see a demo in action [here](https://arcadie-alice-demo.herokuapp.com/diffs/).

# Setup

It's just a plain old RoR application, so standard RoR deployment ðŸ˜Š

TLDR:

```
	export RAILS_ENV=production
	rails assets:precompile
	rails db:migrate
	rails server
```

You also need to setup a daily cron on `./bin/cli.rb check`

Config modifications are restricted to admin people by a password protection.
So you need to set environment variable with admin username (`LOGIN_USERNAME`) and password (`LOGIN_PASSWORD`).
You can do this on the `.env.production` file (managed by [`dotenv-rails`](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)).
